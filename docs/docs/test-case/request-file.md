## Features

A [**request file**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/test/http-files?view=aspnetcore-9.0) can contain one or more HTTP requests. To separate requests, use the `###` comment line between two requests.

### Named Request

You can also name your requests for easier management by adding a metadata line just before request definition:

```http
# @name RequestName
GET https:/localhost:3001/customers
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "Id": 3,
    "FirstName": "Alice",
    "LastName": "Johnson",
    "Email": "alice.johnson@example.com"
}
```

### Variables

All variables can be used in the request file with the `{{variableName}}` notation.

>üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è When you want to use **reference types for variables**, make sure that they override `ToString()` method. During variable resolution, `ToString()` will be called on them.

For **named requests**, you can access request and response data using the following syntax:

```http
{{requestName.(request|response).(body|headers).(*|JPath|XPath)}}

# Example that will fetch 'Id' property from 'AddNewCarRequest' request's JSON body
{{AddNewCarRequest.request.body.$.Id}}
```

This gives you comprehensive access to headers and body content of named requests.
